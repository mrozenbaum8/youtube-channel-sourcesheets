Practical things I've learned:
Making this videos is helping me remember the material learned.
The importance of a schedule with blocks of time.
Balancing learning with extracurriculars.
Learn hard. Relax hard. Hack to prevent or delay burnout. I still feel ecxited and looking forward to learning even after this relatively tough lesson.

Technical things I've learned:
Flexbox
<display:flex;>Flex container
any element can be both a flex container and a flex item
the main axis vs cross. <flex-direction:row vs column>
I see myself using this alot: <flex-wrap> wrap flex containers (similar to word wrap on vscode)
<flex-flow> combines felx-wrap and flex-flow
first excersise felt like piece of ice cream cake. then I felt confident.
second excersise felt like getting hit with a hammer in the head
third and fourth were equally hard but got easier thanks to mentality
learned about git remote remove origin
getting much comfortable with terminal and git. they really are the bread and butter of coding.

lots of back and forth between OP and MDN: repeating same info. solifity knowledge.

the only easy homework was yesterday's. the only easy assignment was the previous one.

Future:
I've starting building my curriculum for once I finish my current one.
I will be making a separate video outside the #100daysofcode series where I show some interesting options.
