Ok. I consider the content up until this point a "taste of programming". If your goal was to challenge yourself with learning something new and completing a coding challenge, and you don't necesarrily want to continue with a carreer in programming - then you have suceeded, and you can stop here. If however, you want to move on learning more advanced topics and you want to pursue a career in computer science - continue below.

21. Choose ONE of the following courses based on your interests: 
    a. Game development: https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-game-development
    b. Artificial intelligence: https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python
    c. Mobile app dev: https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-mobile-app-development-with-react-native
    d. Wed programming: https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript

At this point you should be able to apply for a paid/unpaid internship at a company or an entry level programming job.
Prepare for coding interviews (brush up on data structures and algorithms): https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms and https://leetcode.com 


Or follow up with a proper Algorithms and Data Structures course:
Pre-requisites:

    https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+6.042J+2T2019/course/
    https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/pages/1.-differentiation/part-a-definition-and-basic-rules/session-1-introduction-to-derivatives/

Course:
    https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/pages/syllabus/

or Princeton's version: https://online.princeton.edu/algorithms-part-i

If however you would like to pursue a BSc in Computer Science - continue below. Upon successful completion of courses 24-27 (via the validated certificate route) you will be exempt from core modules of the computer science degree and transfer 60 credits towards your BSc.
