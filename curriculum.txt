Ok. I consider the content up until this point a "taste of programming". If your goal was to challenge yourself with learning something new and completing a coding challenge, and you don't necesarrily want to continue with a carreer in programming - then you have suceeded, and you can stop here. If however, you want to move on learning more advanced topics and you want to pursue a career in computer science - continue below.

21. Choose ONE of the following courses based on your interests: 
    a. Game development: https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-game-development
    b. Artificial intelligence: https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python
    c. Mobile app dev: https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-mobile-app-development-with-react-native
    d. Wed programming: https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript

At this point you should be able to apply for a paid/unpaid internship at a company or an entry level programming job. If however you would like to pursue a BSc in Computer Science - continue below. Upon successful completion of courses 24-27 (via the validated certificate route) you will be exempt from core modules of the computer science degree (and transfer 60 credits towards your BSc).
