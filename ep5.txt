Practical things I've learned:
Making this videos is helping me remember the material learned.
The importance of a schedule with blocks of time.
Balancing learning with extracurriculars.
Learn hard. Relax hard. Hack to prevent or delay burnout. I still feel ecxited and looking forward to learning even after this relatively tough lesson.

Technical things I've learned:
chrome devtools documentation
the box model
block vs inline vs inline-block
flex vs inline flex
css box
width and height
padding
border
margin
standard vs border-box models
shorthand vs longhand properties (width, height etc)
margin collapsing: not the total of the two margins

Future:
I've starting building my curriculum for once I finish my current one.
